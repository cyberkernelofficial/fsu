## Overview
FSU (Fake Super User) is a script designed to emulate superuser or root access within the Termux environment.
By utilizing proot-distro and Ubuntu, FSU aims to replicate the functionalities of a superuser without the need for actual root permissions.
This GitHub repository provides users with a tool to enhance their Termux experience by offering pseudo-root capabilities for running commands that typically require elevated privileges.

### Features
- **Pseudo-Root Access**: FSU enables users to simulate root access within Termux, allowing them to execute commands that necessitate superuser permissions.
- **Proot-Distro Integration**: The script leverages proot-distro to establish a pseudo-chroot environment, mimicking the behavior of a root user.
- **Ubuntu Distribution**: FSU downloads and sets up an Ubuntu environment within Termux, providing users with a familiar Linux distribution to work with.
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Users can access a range of root-level commands and operations within the Ubuntu environment created by FSU.
